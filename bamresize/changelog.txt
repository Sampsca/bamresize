Version History:

v1.5 (17 February 2003)
     * Latest release on PPG

v2.1 (13 October 2013)
     * Implemented Avenger_teambg's end main() and resizeFrame() fixes from <http://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php/topic,28376.0.html>
     * Fixed a bug in compressFrame() that caused pixel row misalignment in BAM frames after resize under some circumstances.

v2.2 (11 January 2014)
     * Width and height resizing is decoupled to allow specifying separate values.  Use "-p" to scale width and "-q" to scale height. Whichever ones not specified will default to 75%.

v2.3 (19 January 2014)
     * Value of -q (height) now defaults to the -p (width) value (instead of 75%) if it is otherwise unspecified.
