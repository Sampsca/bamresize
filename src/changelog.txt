Version History:

v1.5 (17 February 2003)
     * Latest release on PPG

v2.1 (13 October 2013)
     * Implemented Avenger_teambg's end main() and resizeFrame() fixes from <http://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php/topic,28376.0.html>
     * Fixed a bug in compressFrame() that caused pixel row misalignment in BAM frames after resize under some circumstances.

v2.2 (11 January 2014)
     * Width and height resizing is decoupled to allow specifying separate values.  Use "-p" to scale width and "-q" to scale height. Whichever ones not specified will default to 75%.

v2.3 (19 January 2014)
     * Value of -q (height) now defaults to the -p (width) value (instead of 75%) if it is otherwise unspecified.

v2.4 (18 March 2015)
     * Fixed a bug in the frame offset calculations of negative numbers.
     * Added option to not recalculate (scale) frame offsets with resize. ['-n' or '--norecalcoffset']
     * Added option to modify (either increment or decrement) x and y offsets by a positive or negative number. ['-x NUMBER' or '--modxoffset NUMBER'] and ['-y NUMBER' or '--modyoffset NUMBER']
     * Added option to set x and y offsets to a positive or negative number.  ['-s NUMBER' or '--setxoffset NUMBER'] and ['-t NUMBER' or '--setyoffset NUMBER']
     * Compiled into self-contained EXE.

v2.5 (16 June 2015)
     * Added option to pad the frames (with transparent pixels) before resizing them to ensure the resized dimensions and offsets are uniform.  This eliminates frame 'twitching' when resized.  ['-u' or '--unify']
     * Added option to trim the padding (transparent pixels) from the frames after resizing them.  This is the opposite of --unify.  ['-t' or '--trim']
     * Removed option to not recalculate (scale) frame offsets with resize. ['-n' or '--norecalcoffset']
     * Modified the option to set the y offset to a positive or negative number to use ['-v NUMBER' or '--setyoffset NUMBER'] instead of ['-t NUMBER' or '--setyoffset NUMBER']

v2.6 (20 June 2015)
     * Improved handling of very small frame dimensions (<= 1 px).
     * Added undocumented ['-d' or '--debug'] option to print some debug information to console.

v2.7 (22 June 2015)
     * Updated Python to v2.1.3, updated PyWin32 to Build 151, and upgraded the Python Imaging Library to v1.1.5.
     * Included installers for the above plus PyInstaller for posterity.
     * Included the entire PIL with BAM Resizer.
     * Added option to export the frames as BMPs. ['-e' or '--export']
     * Fixed several bugs in how input Options were processed.
     * Unify and Trim options are now ON by default and require a second parameter when specified: ['-u VALUE' or '--unify VALUE'] and ['-t VALUE' or '--trim VALUE']
     * Unify can now pad the frames until they are square by setting the option's value to 2.  ['-u 2' or '--unify 2']
